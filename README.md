# FloatingClock
Java Floating clock to sit in the corner of the screen above all other programs. 
Will serve as my 2nd monitor clock although I'm yet to test it on a multi-screen system.

FloatingClock is A simple utility application written in Java that displays the current system time in the top right of the screen. 
It provides light customisation such as opacity, color and font size. Only tested on Windows. Not tested on multi-screen system.

Once compiled, run FloatingClock to launch. Alternatively, place all files in an executable jar and specify FloatingClock 
as the main class.
